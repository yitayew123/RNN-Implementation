EV Car Price Prediction Using XGBoost and Streamlit
===========================================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
This project focuses on predicting electric vehicle (EV) prices using the XGBoost machine learning algorithm. 
The model is trained on historical EV data to provide accurate price predictions based on key features.

A Streamlit web application is included to allow users to input car features interactively and receive 
real-time predicted prices.

Features:
---------
- Accurate EV price predictions using XGBoost.
- Interactive Streamlit interface for real-time predictions.
- Includes data preprocessing for reliable predictions.
- Easily extendable to new features or datasets.

Installation:
-------------
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yitayew123/XGBOOST.git
   cd XGBOOST

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
   python -m venv XGBOOST_ENV
   # Activate environment:
   # Linux/Mac:
   source XGBOOST_ENV/bin/activate
   # Windows:
   XGBOOST_ENV\Scripts\activate

3. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage:
------
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py

2. Open the local URL provided by Streamlit in your browser.

3. Enter EV car features in the input fields to get predicted prices instantly.
